**For simple use cases, refer to [google-sr][github-gsr]**

This package provides a set of CSS selectors for parsing Google search results, using tools such as [cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio), etc...

These selectors are compatible only with the search results page returned when the following user-agent is used:
`Mozilla/5.0 (MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/5.0)`.

#### Important Note:
Due to the constantly evolving nature of Google's search page structure, we cannot guarantee consistent
usage/validity of these selectors. Unless you are an advanced user with specific requirements, **we highly recommend
using the [google-sr][github-gsr] package instead** of
relying directly on google-sr-selectors.

#### CommonJS / ESM Notice

Currently this package provides both [CommonJS (CJS)][cjs-nodejs-docs] and [ES Modules (ESM)][esm-nodejs-docs] builds.

**Starting in version 7.x (subject to change), we plan to publish ESM-only releases and remove the CJS build.**  
As a result, you will no longer be able to use `require()` to import this package; you must use `import` instead.  
(*If youâ€™re on Node.js v20 or later, you can still use `require()` with ESM modules natively.* [See release note][nodejs-v20-backport-note])

While Node.js v20+ supports ESM well, weâ€™ll wait until its EOL before removing CJS to allow more time for transition.

> Note: This only affects Node.js users. Runtimes like Bun and Deno already support ESM natively.

See [this gist][esm-migration-pure-esm-gist] and our [GitHub discussion][cjs-build-notice-discussion] for migration help.
