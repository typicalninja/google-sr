**For simple use cases, refer to [google-sr][github-gsr]**

This package provides a set of CSS selectors for parsing Google search results, using tools such as [cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio), etc...

These selectors are compatible only with the search results page returned when the following user-agent is used:
`Links (2.29; Linux 6.11.0-13-generic x86_64; GNU C 13.2; text)`.

#### Important Note:
Due to the constantly evolving nature of Google's search page structure, we cannot guarantee consistent 
usage/validity of these selectors. Unless you are an advanced user with specific requirements, **we highly recommend 
using the [google-sr][github-gsr] package instead** of 
relying directly on google-sr-selectors.

# Notice for CommonJS users

This package currently includes both [CommonJS (CJS)][cjs-nodejs-docs] and [ES Modules (ESM)][esm-nodejs-docs] builds.

Starting with **v7.x** (subject to change), we plan to drop CJS support and publish only ESM-only builds.

#### Why ESM-only going forward?
- **Modern JavaScript**: ESM is now the standard, offering better support for tree-shaking and static analysis.
- **Reduces package size**: Maintaining a single build reduces package size and build complexity.
- [Node.js `v20`+ supports require() on ESM modules natively][nodejs-v20-backport-note] (no flags needed)

While Node.js v20 already supports ESM well, we will wait until its End-of-Life before removing CJS to give users and tooling more time to transition.

> Note: This applies only to Node.js users, other runtimes like Bun and Deno already support ESM natively

See this [gist for future migration tips][esm-migration-pure-esm-gist] and our [GitHub discussion][cjs-build-notice-discussion] for more details.
