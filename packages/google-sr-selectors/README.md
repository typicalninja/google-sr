Set of html selectors for parsing google search results with jquery like modules (ex: cheerio).

Please note that the included selectors are intended for the **non-Javascript** version of Google Search page. 
These were obtained by appending `&gbv=1` to the regular query link.

ex: (disable javascript, else it will redirect): [query `nodejs`](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=nodejs&gbv=1)
