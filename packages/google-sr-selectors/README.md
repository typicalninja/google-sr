**For simple use cases, refer to [google-sr][github-gsr]**

This package provides a set of CSS selectors for parsing Google search results, using tools such as [cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio), etc...

These selectors are compatible only with the search results page returned when the following user-agent is used:
`Links (2.29; Linux 6.11.0-13-generic x86_64; GNU C 13.2; text)`.

#### Important Note:
Due to the constantly evolving nature of Google's search page structure, we cannot guarantee consistent 
usage/validity of these selectors. Unless you are an advanced user with specific requirements, **we highly recommend 
using the [google-sr][github-gsr] package instead** of 
relying directly on google-sr-selectors.
