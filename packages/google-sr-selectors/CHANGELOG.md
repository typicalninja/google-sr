  This release adds new CSS selectors for extracting metadata from Google search results:

  The `metaSource` and `metaAd` selectors are nested within the `metaContainer` element.

  ```ts
  const OrganicSearchSelector = {
    metaContainer: "span.qXLe6d.dXDvrc",
    metaSource: "span.fYyStc:last-of-type",
    metaAd: "span.dloBPe.fYyStc",
  };

  const results = await search({
    query: "latest news",
